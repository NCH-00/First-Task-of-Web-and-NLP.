# First-Task-of-Web-and-NLP.

#  Description of the task:
The idea of the task is to create a web page to control the directions of the robot containing 5 buttons Left, Right, Forward, Backward, and Stop. When choosing a specific button, it will be stored in a database connected to the web page, and through that database, we can extract the last stored value and use it to communicate with the engines and give them orders to go to the specific location.

# Steps of the task:

1- Create a web page in html and css languages that contains the robot movement direction buttons.
2- Create a database on the phpmyadmin website of the type mysql and create a DR table inside it and it contains two columns, the first column is id and the second is directions.
3- Create a php file that contains codes to add data and queries to DR database, and use the php file to link the web page with the database.
4- Open xampp and run the server and mysql database.
5- When you open the local server, a web page will appear connected to the php file and the database
